## Gamma and Hadron Ray Lengths

Analyzing gamma and hadron ray lengths using K Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and a simple Neural Net. 
I reclassified the data using Pandas and implemented the algorithims using Sci Kit Learn and Keras.
Visualzed the data using MatPlotLib

## Seoul Bike Usage 

Using Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and a Neural Net to predict the bike usage on a given day based on temperature, radiation, visibility, wind, and humidity.
Cleaned the data using Pandas and visualized the data using MatPlotLib
